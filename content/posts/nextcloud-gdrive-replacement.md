How many of you use Google Drive?

It‚Äôs integrated into Gmail, every attachment you open gets added to your GDrive, not to mention they share the space, so every file and email in Gmail also goes against your 15GB cap.
Google regularly scans and data mines every single word and file you have in your Drive, juicy food for their ever-learning AI, but that is all to make life more convenient for us? Right?

There is a good alternative in my opinion, but this is just my opinion, it‚Äôs *hard* to setup, depending how much Linux knowledge you have, but once it‚Äôs done, it‚Äôs your *own cloud* file storage üòÄ

The web app in question is

Now‚Ä¶ I am not gonna show you how to actually setup your Nextcloud instance ‚Äì how dare I not show you, right? Well... that would be a never ending post‚Ä¶ but you can find hundreds of videos showing how to install it, as well as an official guide on their website. I would recommend you install it on [Digitalocean](https://m.do.co/c/aff79d8ca2f0), maybe even using my referral code? :3

If you need any help, feel free to drop a comment below and I will reply as soon as I can üôÇ

Why Nextcloud? Well... it offers a web interface, which can be used from where ever. duh.

They also have Android and iOS apps. The android app has worked without a single problem for me for months, not to mention with an additional app, which requires a single payment, and you can also sync your contacts :O More about this in the Google Free Android post which I am currently working on‚Ä¶

But hey dude, this doesn‚Äôt actually let me edit my documents online‚Ä¶ what gives? That can also be solved but requires even a bit more work. Take a read at [Collabora Online](https://nextcloud.com/collaboraonline) at Nextcloud, and read it a few times until you get a better understanding of what you have to do, took me a few tries before I  figured it all out and properly enabled it. If you can get it to work, send me an email, we can figure something out üôÇ
